## Quetions ##
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
  It is different from working directory because working directory can have a temparary files or files which has bug and not in state to commit. But in staging are every file must be in state to commit.
  so having staging area is good to track state of file and can be use to commit multiple related files in one commit.











## NOTES ## 

staging area : Before the git commit  we can create a set of related files which can be part of one commit. by git add command we can create a that set of file which is nothing but staging area.

git branch experiment : Make a new branch named as experiment.
